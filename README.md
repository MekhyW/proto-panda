# Protopanda

__[Vers√£o em portugues: üáßüá∑](README.pt-br.md)__

Protopanda is a open source patform (firmware and hardware), for controling protogens. The idea is to be simple enough so all you need is just a bit of tech savy to make it work. But at the same time, flexible enough so an person with the minimum knowledge of lua can make amazing things.

# Powering 

__TLDR: At least a power bank of 20W with PD and usb-c.__

There are two modes, one powering 5V directly from USB, and other that has some power management (buck converter), that needs from 6.5v up to 12v. This second mode is enabled only via hardware changes on the PCB.
Each hub75 panel can consume up to 2A when maximum brightness, so powering directly from USB at 5v can be problematic, so this version with the regulator triggers the PD on the usb, requesting 9V 3A, and this is plenty of power to light up both panels, sadly this version consumes way more power.

Since on most cases you wont be running them at full brightness and neither all leds on white, its reccomended the 5V version.


# Panels

The panels used are also known as HUB75 panels. They are driven by [mrcodetastic's hub75 lib](https://github.com/mrcodetastic/ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-DMA), and these are the [recommended panels](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/4000002686894.html).
![HUB75 panels](doc/panels.jpg "HUB75 panels")
They're multiplexed, which means only a few LEDs are on at a given time. It is fast enough that it can't be seen by the eye. But during direct sunlight, it's hard to take a good photo without screen tearing.
![Screen tearing caught on camera](doc/tearing.jpg "Screen tearing caught on camera")

The resolution is 64 pixels wide and 32 pixels tall. Being two panels side by side, the total area is 128x32px. The color depth is 16 pixels, being RGB565, which means red (0-32), green (0-64), and blue (0-32).

## Double buffer

To prevent another type of tearing when a frame is being drawn while the frame is being changed, we enable the use of double buffering. This means that we draw pixels to the frame, but they won't appear on the screen immediately. Instead, we're drawing in memory. When we call `flipPanelBuffer()`, the memory we drew is sent to the DMA to be constantly drawn on the panel. Then, the buffer we use to draw changes. This increased the memory usage, but it's a price needed to pay.

# Face and expressions

Protopanda uses images from the SD card and a few JSON files to construct the animation sequences. All images must be `PNG`; later, they're decoded to a raw format and stored in the [frame bulk file](#bulk-file).

- [Loading Frames](#loading-frames)
- [Expressions](#expressions)
- [Expression Stack](#expression-stack)
- [Bulk File](#bulk-file)
- [Managed Mode](#managed-mode)

### Loading Frames  
To load frames, add them to the SD card and specify their locations in the `config.json` file:  

```json
{
  "frames": [
    {"pattern": "/expressions/normal_by_maremar (%d).png", "flip_left": true, "from": 1, "to": 4, "name": "frames_normal"},
    {"pattern": "/expressions/noise (%d).png", "flip_left": false, "from": 1, "to": 3, "name": "frames_noise"},
    {"pattern": "/expressions/amogus (%d).png", "flip_left": true, "from": 1, "to": 2, "name": "frames_amogus"},
    {"pattern": "/expressions/boop_cycle_%d.png", "flip_left": true, "from": 1, "to": 3, "name": "frames_boop"},
    {"pattern": "/expressions/boop_transition_%d.png", "flip_left": true, "from": 1, "to": 3, "name": "frames_boop_transition"}
  ],
  "expressions": [],
  "scripts": [],
  "boop": {}
}
```

> **Note:** Modifying `config.json` (adding/removing files) forces the system to rebuild the [frame bulk file](#bulk-file).  

Each entry in the `frames` array can be either:  
- A file path, **or**  
- An object describing multiple files.  
  *(Tip: Use [this tool](https://onlinetexttools.com/printf-text) for `printf`-style patterns.)*  

#### Frame Object Properties  
- **`pattern`** (string)  
  Uses `%d` as a placeholder for numbers (like `printf`). Requires `from` and `to` fields.  
  **Example:**  
  ```json
  {"pattern": "/bolinha/input-onlinegiftools-%d.png", "from": 1, "to": 155}
  ```  
  Loads frames from `/bolinha/input-onlinegiftools-1.png` to `...-155.png`.  

- **`flip_left`** (boolean)  
  Flips the left-side frame horizontally (useful for panel orientation).  

- **`name`** (string)  
  Assigns an identifier to a frame or group. The name refers to the first frame in the `pattern`.  
  *Why?* Hardcoding frame orders (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`) becomes problematic if you later insert a new frame. Names act as offsets for flexibility.  

- **`color_scheme_left`** (string)  
  Flips specific color channels if needed.  

---

### Expressions  
After loading frames, [Lua scripts](#programming-in-lua) manage expressions. These are defined in `/expressions.json`:  

```json
{
  "frames": [],
  "expressions": [
    {
      "name": "normal",
      "frames": "frames_normal",
      "animation": [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3],
      "duration": 250
    },
    {
      "name": "sus",
      "frames": "frames_amogus",
      "animation": "auto",
      "duration": 200
    },
    {
      "name": "noise",
      "frames": "frames_noise",
      "animation": "auto",
      "duration": 5,
      "onEnter": "ledsStackCurrentBehavior(); ledsSegmentBehavior(0, BEHAVIOR_NOISE); ledsSegmentBehavior(1, BEHAVIOR_NOISE)",
      "onLeave": "ledsPopBehavior()"
    },
    {
      "name": "boop",
      "frames": "frames_boop",
      "animation": [1, 2, 3, 2],
      "duration": 250
    },
    {
      "name": "boop_begin",
      "frames": "frames_boop_transition",
      "animation": [1, 2, 3],
      "duration": 250,
      "transition": true
    },
    {
      "name": "boop_end",
      "frames": "frames_boop_transition",
      "animation": [3, 2, 1],
      "duration": 250,
      "transition": true
    }
  ],
  "scripts": [],
  "boop": {}
}
```

#### Expression Properties  
- **`name`** (string, *optional*)  
  Identifies the animation (e.g., for menus or scripting).  

- **`frames`** (string)  
  References a frame group from `config.json`.  

- **`animation`** (int[] or `"auto"`)  
  - `int[]`: Explicit frame order (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).  
  - `"auto"`: Sequential frames (e.g., `1, 2, 3...`).  

- **`duration`** (int)  
  Frame display time (in milliseconds).  

- **`hidden`** (string)  
  Hide from menu selection 

- **`intro`** (string)  
  This parameter is a name of another animation that MUST be a `tranistion=true`. A anima√ß√£o ser√° tocada sempre que essa express√£o entrar

- **`outro`** (string)  
  This parameter is a name of another animation that MUST be a transition. This transition will play whenever the current animation stops running

- **`transition`** (boolean)  
  If `true`, the animation plays once and reverts to the previous state.  This will force the animation to stack and not remove the previous one

- **`repeats`** (int, default 1)
  If the animation is the type of a `transition`, you can set this to force it to repeat N times

- **`onEnter`** (string, Lua code)  
  Executes when the animation starts.  

- **`onLeave`** (string, Lua code)  
  Executes when the animation ends (either due to `transition=true` or interruption).  

## Expression stack

The expressions are stored in a stack. So when you add an animation that doesn't repeat, it will pause the current animation and run until the end of the new animation. If you add two at the same time, the last one will be executed. When it finishes, the previous one will run.

## Bulk file

Even with the SD card, changing frames is not quite fast. The SD card interface is not fast enough. To make it faster, the images are PNG decoded to raw pixel data stored in RGB565 format inside the internal flash. All frames are stored in a single file called the `Bulk file`. This is done in a way that the frames are stored sequentially, and by keeping the file open, the transfer speed is accelerated, achieving 60fps.
Every time you add or modify a new frame, it's needed to rebuild this file. This can be done in the menu or by calling the Lua function `composeBulkFile`.

## Managed mode

The animations are processed by Core 0, so you don't have to waste some precious time on the [lua scripts](#programming-in-lua) updating it. 
It is possible to change the frame using Lua scripts... But it's also wasteful. So leave it to the other core, and you only have to worry about selecting which expressions you want!
During managed mode, the frame drawing is handled by Core 0.

# LED strips

Protopanda suport the WS2812B adderessable led protocol and it provies a simple crude system to defining a few behaviors for the strip/matrices
![alt text](doc/A7301542.JPG)

![alt text](doc/ewm.drawio.png)


# Bluetooth

Protopanda uses BLE. So far, its configured to handle the fursuit paw. Its info and all source code and hardware are found here https://github.com/mockthebear/ble-fursuit-paw
![alt text](doc/integration.png)

Is consists of a BLE device with an LSM6DS3 3 axis accelerometer/gyro and 5 buttons. It keeps sending the sensor readings and buttons every 50~100ms.

The default UUID of the ble fursuit paw is `d4d31337-c4c3-c2c3-b4b3-b2b1a4a3a2a1` and the service for the accelerometer/gyro/buttons is `d4d3afaf-c4c3-c2c3-b4b3-b2b1a4a3a2a1`
If you want more than one remote control, is reccomended to reflash the firmware of another controller and set the `c4c3` part of the uuid to `c4c4` or somethig else.

To set both devices to be accepted, add in your `onSetup`:
```lua
function onSetup()
    startBLE()
    acceptBLETypes("d4d31337-c4c1-c2c3-b4b3-b2b1a4a3a2a1", "afaf", "fafb")
    beginBleScanning()
```

I know, I know... its static and have no flexibility to accept any kind of BLE devices / services... Its a planned feature


# Hardware

Protopanda is designed to run on Esp32s3-n16r8, which is a version with 16MB Flash, 384kB ROM, 512 Kb RAM, and 8MB octal PSRAM.
It is required to be this version with more space and the PSRAM to have enough RAM to run the panels, BLE, and [lua](#programming-in-lua) together.

On the hardware, there is a port for the HUB75 data, an SD card connector, two screw terminals for the 5V out, the power in pins, one I2C port, and the LED strip pin.

## Two cores
Protopanda uses and abuses the two cores in the ESP32.  
* **Core 0**
By default, Core 0 is primarily designed to manage Bluetooth. When not doing so, it manages the animations, and when [Managed mode](#managed-mode) is active, it also handles the LED screen updating.
* **Core 1**
The second core handles non-screen-related tasks. It has the routine that checks the [power level](#powering), updates the inputs, reads sensors, and calls the Lua function onLoop.

- [Cycle Expressions Each Second](#cycle-expressions-each-second)

## Minimum lua script
```lua
--Minimum lua script on init.lua

function onSetup()
  --Function is called once, here you may start the BLE, begin scanning, configure panel, set power mode, load lib and prepare led strips and even power on
  --All calls here are called from SETUP, running on core 0
end

function onPreflight()
  --Upon here, the all lua calls are called from core 1. You can even leave this function in blank.
  --Core 0 will only start managing after 100ms (the final beep)
end

function onLoop(dt)
  --This function will be called in loop. 
  --The dt parameter is the difference in MS from the begin of the last frame and current one. Useful for storing elapsed time
end
```
## Cycle expressions each second
```lua
local expressions = dofile("/lualib/expressions.lua")
local changeExpressionTimer = 1000 --1 second

function onSetup()
  setPanelMaxBrightness(64)
  panelPowerOn() --Brightness always start at 0
  gentlySetPanelBrightness(64)
end

function onPreflight()
  setPanelManaged(true)
  expressions.Next()
end

function onLoop(dt)
  changeExpressionTimer = changeExpressionTimer - dt 
  if changeExpressionTimer <= 0 then 
    changeExpressionTimer = 1000 --1 second
    expressions.Next()
  end
end
```
